It is project we worked on in our 'Database Management System' course in out university. Primary idea belongs to Fahim Faisal Deepto. We got around one and a half months to implement it.

Travelling is common for all of us. However, we always don't know all the information about a place we want to go to. Sometimes we want to go somewhere, but we don’t know which transportation would be the best for us or worse we even don’t know the fare and some people take advantage of that. For example - if anyone lives in Dhanmondi, it is quite possible that they don't have any idea about Mirpur. Once I had to go to a place named ‘Shah Ali Bagh’ in Mirpur, which was very far from the main road. I had to take a rickshaw from the bus stand. Later, I came to know that he took double the actual fare. I also came to know that there were another transportation, electric three-wheelers, which would cost half the fare of a rickshaw. If I had known this before, then the trip would have been much easier for me. Sometimes, we all wish that we had some kind of information before going somewhere unknown. That’s where our project is going to be helpful.

Our project prototype is a website where all this information is available. Here users have to sign in for their account. Users can enter a starting place and a destination, and our software leads them through the shortest and easiest path. A user can both give and receive information about the desired destination they are looking for. A user can see the information that already exists, or they can even ask new queries. They can rate the information whether it was helpful or not. When a user is giving information then their interface switches to guide mode. In the guide mode, users can answer queries. For every ‘helpful’ rating, the guide earns 10 points. When a guide reaches 10,000 points, they can withdraw the points as real money; (here for 10,000 points they will get 100 takas). Users can also update their personal information in their profiles.

Both user and guide can report their problems so that the admin can solve the bug or issues that they are facing. Here admin can look after all the data present in the database and can insert, delete and update the database. There will be a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section for the users and guides so that they can look up common queries. The other queries will be answered by the admin.

In conclusion, we have tried to implement the project as much as we could within 40 days (given time). However, we could not implement all the features in the end, which are notification and money withdraw. We plan to implement those in the future.
